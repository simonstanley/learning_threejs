  <!-- So here are the two shaders. We are going to make the simplist shaders possible. -->

  <!-- Vertex shader -->
  <script type="x-shader/x-vertex" id="vertexshader">
      // Both shaders must have a main function.
      void main()
      {
	  // The only thing the vertex shader has to do is set the position of each
	  // vertex. For this simple case we set the position to its current 
          // position. Yes this is stupid but it gives us a chance to introduce that 
          // there are certain variables available, kindly provided to us by Three.js...
          // Notice the script type, this is not recognised by html and so is not
          // executed. Instead the script element is referenced in the javascript 
          // (using its id) and passed to Three.js. Three.js then suppies this 
          // function with a bunch of varibles which we can use.
          // Here are 3 important ones, projectionMatrix, modelViewMatrix and position.
          // What you see below is setting the position to its current position, the
          // projectionMatrix and modelViewMatrix are used to convert our 3D position
          // (given by the variable 'position') into a 2D projection for our screens.
          // Hence, this is a very common line of code in vertex shaders (except that
          // position may be a variable like newPosition which we've made ourselves).
	  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
      }
  </script>


  <!-- Fragment shader -->
  <script type="x-shader/x-fragment" id="fragmentshader">
      void main()
      {
          // The only thing the fragment shader has to do is set the colour for each
          // fragment. Here we set everything to white... I won't go into rbga codes in 
          // this guide.
	  gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
      }
