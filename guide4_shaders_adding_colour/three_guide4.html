  <!-- Vertex shader -->
  <script type="x-shader/x-vertex" id="vertexshader">

      // So here we define our variables. For this to work, the uniforms and attributes must
      // be defined to match the uniforms and attributes we made in the js file exactly.
      // But notice the attribute amount_of_red is a float, not an array. This is because this
      // is run for each vertex seperately, and only one value from the attribute array we defined 
      // in the javascript is fed in at a time (and the values in the array were floats!)
      attribute float amount_of_red;
      uniform float amount_of_blue;
      uniform float amount_of_green;
      
      // So what are we doing with these? We are going make our own new colour variable within the
      // the vertex shader. This will be a vector of length 4 (red, blue, green, alpha) (alpha is 
      // the opacity, we'll just set this to 1) and will represent the vertex colour.

      // Now here's where it gets a little complex. We will define a colour vector, as stated, but
      // there's nothing attaching it to the actual vertex. This can be done, but is rarely done as
      // the vertex colour is simpler to define when we build our mesh in the javascript. Also, the
      // the vertex itself is just a corner point so colouring it on its own won't look very 
      // dramatic. What we want is each vertex to have a unique colour which spills into each of 
      // the faces around it. These faces are coloured by the fragment shader, so the fragment 
      // shader needs to know the colour we want for each vertex. Here we have the perfect situation 
      // for a varying variable (hmm!).
      // Lets call our vector colour variable vColor. We will build it properly in the main shader
      // function but now we know we want it to be passed to the fragment shader we should first 
      // define it as a varying.
      varying vec4 vColor;

      void main()
      {
          // So now we can build it.
          vColor = vec4(amount_of_red, amount_of_blue, amount_of_green, 1.0);
          // Remeber the gl_Position HAS to be set. Like before, we are just setting it to its 
          // current position.
	  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);

          // the fragment shader now knows about all the colours we've assigned to each vertex.
          // As mentioned in guide 3, the fragment shader HAS to set gl_FragColor. Well, by giving
          // it our varying variable vColor, for each fragment on each face, it takes the three 
          // surrounding vertex colours, works out where it is in relation to each (near or far),
          // and assigns that fragment an appropriately blended colour. Don't ask me how.
